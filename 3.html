      <header><h2>What Equipment You Need</h2></header>
      <p class="description">Setting up a home recording studio doesn’t need to cost a fortune. Most people spend wat too much on equipment. When what they should be focusing on is their skills.
         Learn your gear inside out before you even consider upgrading.</p>
      <p class="description">8 key pieces of equipment for a successful home studio setup:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Audio Interface</li>
        <li>Microphone</li>
        <li>Microphone Cable</li>
        <li>Microphone Stand</li>
        <li>Pop Filter</li>
        <li>Headphone</li>
        <li>Moniter Speakers</li>
        <li>Acoustic Treatment</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="description">With this home recording studio equipment alone, you can start getting audio work from the comfort of your own home.
        But even then, some of these items are optional. For example don’t necessarily need speakers or acoustic treatment, as a lot of people learn to mix on headphones.<br><br>
        Let’s look at each item in a bit more detail.
      </p>
      <aritcle>
        <h3 class="list">1. Audio Interface</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Most people chose to use a USB audio interface. This piece of home recording studio equipment allows you to connect the microphone, speakers, and headphones to your computer.
          For a beginner, the best bang-for-your-buck is either the <strong>Focusrite 2i2</strong>Focusrite 2i2 or one of <strong>Native Instrument Komplete</strong> Audio interfaces.

        <p class="description">
          If you need more channels (for recording drums or a large choir), you will need a larger interface. You could check out the <strong>Focusrite 18i8. </strong>
          Eventually, you might also want to upgrade to something with better preamps and converters. Once you are ready to upgrade, you could absolutely check out the <strong>Apollo Twin Duo</strong>.

        <h3 class="list">2. Microphone</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Start off with a cardioid large diaphragm condenser microphone for your studio.
          You want to give preference to cardioid microphones when recording at home. They reject sound from the rear, so are useful for less-than-perfect rooms.
          And the perfect type of microphone for your home recording studio is a large diaphragm condenser.
          This mic type sounds great on vocals, acoustic guitars, and other acoustic sources.
          The recommendation of this guide is the <strong>SE Electronics SE2200A</strong>. It’s a good condenser mic, a great general microphone for music, and a good vocal mic too. In my opinion, the best condenser mic under $300.
          Here is a full review about <strong>SE Electronics SE2200A</strong>:

        <p class="description">Then, if you want to add another microphone to your arsenal, you may want to buy a cardioid dynamic microphone.
          These mics sound better on guitar cabs, percussion and sometimes vocals too.
          One of the best legendary mics is <a class="item-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APBcODtbGqc" target="_blank"><strong>Shure SM57</strong></a>.</p>

      <aritcle>
        <h3 class="list">3. Microphone Cable</h3>
        <img class="cable-image" src="https://musicianonamission.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MCPXLR25-large-e1554829543825.jpg" alt="XLR cable" />
        <p class="description">
          Do not spend too much here. If the cable works, it works. You need a balanced XLR cable. The middle ground is usually best with accessories.
          Do not go for the most expensive option – but do not go for the cheapest either. You should check out the Mogami CorePlus mic cable.
        </p>
      </aritcle>
      <aritcle>
        <h3 class="list">4. Microphone Stand</h3>
        <p class="description"> Go for the middle ground. You need one stand per microphone. Be aware: these stands DO wear out over time. The cheaper you get, the more likely you will have to quickly replace the stand.
          This guider recommends the <strong>K&M 210 Telescoping Boom Stand</strong>.

      <aritcle>
        <h3 class="list">5. Pop Filter</h3>
        <p class="description">If you ever record vocals, you need a pop filter. They are not expensive and will stop plosives from ruining your vocal recordings. Please check out the <a class="item-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ_7ygCRYBM" target="_blank"><strong>Shure PS-6 Popper Stopper</strong></a>.</p>
      </aritcle>
      <aritcle>
        <h3 class="list">6. Headphone</h3>
        <p class="description">
          You have two options here: closed-back or open-back headphones for your studio. Closed-back headphones are for monitoring when recording (or mixing on the fly in public places).
          Open-back headphones are for mixing.<br>

          <li>Closed-back headphone this guide picked:<a class="item-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7ZbHpEhZlU" target="_blank"><strong>Beyer Dynamic DT880 Pro</strong></a></li>

      <aritcle>
        <h3 class="list">7. Monitor Speakers</h3>
        <p class="description">
          It’s difficult to learn how to mix without a set of proper studio monitors. These speakers have a flat response, so you hear the mix as it really is. Normal hi-fi speakers color the sound – not good.
          You can mix on headphones alone. But only after a lot of practice and experience. Even then, it’s always worth checking your mix on monitors.
          Just make sure you read up on proper speaker placement first.<br>
          Make sure your room is acoustically treated if you use this size. If your room isn’t treated (or it’s smaller), check out the Yamaha HS5’s.
          It doesn’t really matter which speakers you chose, though – just buy a pair and stick with them for a long time. Learn how they sound.
          It’s also worth investing in a set of monitor stands or monitor pads.
          You need to be careful how you set your monitors up – we are going to look into this in much more depth later in this guide.

        <h3 class="list">8. Acoustic Treatmeat</h3>
        <img class="room-acoustic-image" src="https://musicianonamission.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/acoustic-treatment-diy.jpg" alt="studio-image" />
        <p class="description">
          Acoustic treatments are foam or fiberglass panels that soak up the natural reverb of the room. When mixing and recording, you want to be using as “neutral” of a room as possible. That way your results aren’t being colored by the sound of your small home studio.
          Fiberglass panels are very good. Rather than purchasing panels (which can be extremely expensive), you could make your own for 1/5th the cost.
          You should also make some bass traps if your low end is out of control
          NOTE: Here is a great video on Acoustics terminology:

      <header><h2>The Perfect Room Setup</h2></header>
      <p class="description">
        You might have the best equipment in the world. But if you don’t set it up properly, your mixes will never improve.
        You don’t NEED to do any of this. But choosing the right room, setting it up properly and adding some affordable acoustic treatment will make your job 10X easier.
      </p>
      <p class="description">There are 5 vital things you must consider when choosing a room:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The size of the room</li>
        <li>The dimensions of the room</li>
        <li>The surfaces within the room</li>
        <li>The height of the ceiling</li>
        <li>Noise level within the room</li>
      </ol>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">1. The size of the room</h3>
        <p class="description">Avoid small rooms. They are an acoustical nightmare.
          The bigger the room, the better. Plus, that means more space for recording (and possibly a drum kit).</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">2. The dimensions of the room</h3>
        <p class="description"><strong>Avoid rooms with equal width and length dimensions.</strong>
          If the room is an exact square, avoid it like the plague. This creates an immense buildup of standing waves (which are bad).</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">3. The surfaces within the room</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Try to avoid rooms with too many reflective, hard surfaces. A kitchen would be the worst place for a home recording studio. But why would you want to do that?
          A room with a floor length window or mirror along a whole wall would be a bad choice. A concrete basement would be a VERY bad choice.
          Wooden floors are desirable as carpet only absorbs high frequencies, which can make the room sound muffled.
          But windows, mirrors, bare concrete, marble etc. are highly undesirable.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">4. The height of the ceiling</h3>
        <p class="description">
          If the ceiling is too low, vertical reflections are going to become much more of an issue. When you record vocals, for example, a strong reflection from the ceiling can cause comb filtering – which is very bad.
          As for mixing, a low ceiling can be equally destructive.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">5. Noise level within the room</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Can you hear passing traffic in the room? Is it next to an A/C unit? Or a boiler? You want the room to be as quiet as possible.
        </p>

    <section id="placing_monitors" class="main-section">
      <header><h2>Placing Your Monitors</h2></header>
      <p>
        Before you consider acoustic treatment, you need to make sure to organize your room in the right way.
        It’s easier to start with an empty room. This gives you a blank canvas to work with. The main thing to consider when designing the layout of your room is the position of the speakers.
        When recording, you are mobile (in most cases). You can move the microphone around the room.
        But once you set up your speakers, they’re gonna stay there. Here’s the ideal way to set up your room.
      </p>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">1. Position the Speakers Away From the Wall </h3>
        <p class="description">
          Many monitor speakers have bass ports on the back. If you position them right up against a wall, they won’t work properly. Check the manufacturers guidelines for the minimum distance between the speaker and the wall.
          Contrary to popular belief, positioning your speakers a foot or two (30-60cm) away from the wall doesn’t always result in a more even bass response.
          In fact, sometimes it can even be detrimental. The reflection from the wall can cause more issues than the bass buildup that comes from having your speakers near a wall.
          Therefore, position your speakers the minimum distance from the wall (according to the manual). Then, if you can, reduce the bass on your speakers.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">2. Distance to the Front Wall and Side Walls Should Be Unequal</h3>
        <div class="flex">
          <p class="description">
            If the speakers are the same distance from the wall behind them (the front wall) as the side walls, move them. This can result in a buildup of standing waves. In turn, this causes some low end frequencies to appear a lot louder than they are.
            For example, if each speaker is 12″ from the rear wall AND 12″ from the side wall, they should be moved.
          </p>

      <article>
        <h3 class="list">3. Position the Speakers Along the Longest Wall </h3>
        <div class="flex">
          <p class="description">
            This ONLY applies if you have a larger room. Your aim here is to reduce the volume of the first reflections from the speakers into your ears.
            Strong reflections from can cause comb filtering and a range of other issues. These come from the nearest walls to the left and right of the speakers.
            You don’t need to know all the details – just know that the first reflections are highly problematic.
            By positioning the speakers along the longest wall, you are moving that reflection point further away from the speakers. This reduces their volume, as they must now travel further before reaching your ears.
            To maintain a symmetrical stereo image, it’s best to position the speakers in the middle of the wall.
          </p>

        <div class="flex">
          <p class="description">
            BUT, if you have a small room, this would be a bad idea.If positioning the speakers along the longest wall causes the listening position to be over halfway across the width of the room… don’t do it.
            To maintain a symmetrical stereo image, it’s best to position the speakers in the middle of the wall.

        <div class="flex">
          <p class="description">
            This only applies to the length of the room AND the distance between the floor and ceiling. If your head is halfway between the front wall and back wall, OR halfway between the floor and ceiling – you will hear a distinct loss in bass. Consider the floor and ceiling as well as the walls.

      <p class="description">
        Acoustic treatment has two main aims:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Correct any problems with the room</li>
        <li>Create an ideal environment for recording/mixing</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="description">
        The study of acoustics is an entire field of physics. But you don’t really need to know any of that in order to treat your room to a good standard.
      </p>
      <article>
        <h3 class="list">Which Type of Treatment?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Acoustic treatment doesn’t have to be expensive. You can build your own acoustic panels if you have the time. Avoid foam acoustic treatment. It seems like this is the best option, but it’s all marketing. Foam treatment only affects high frequencies. In a home recording studio, it’s the low frequencies that are the most problematic.
          Build your own rockwool/fibreglass panels or purchase pre-made absorber panels.

            If you are using rockwool panels, try to make the panels at least 4″ (10cm) thick. You can also add an air gap behind the panel to increase the efficiency.

            After treating the side walls and corners, you can place treatment behind your monitor speakers.
            This will allow you to move them a bit further away from the wall (1 or 2 feet) without suffering the ill effects of comb filtering from the reflections.
            This will result in a more consistent low end (and no need to cut the lows from your speakers any more).

      <header><h2>Room Treatment(For Recording)</h2></header>
      <p class="description">
        So far we have only discussed room setup and treatment for mixing. A room that is ideal for recording has a different set of requirements. For us, though, working in a one-room home recording studio requires some compromises.
        Here are a few tips for creating a hybrid recording/mixing room.

        <h3 class="list">1. Don’t make the room too dead</h3>
        <p class="description">
          In general, you want a ‘live room’ for recording. This means a room that has more diffusive or reflective surfaces, rather than a room with a lot of absorption.
          To find the balance, just be careful not to overtreat your room.
          But, that would be a very hard thing to do.
          Unless you invested considerable time and effort into building or purchasing a high number of absorber panels, the room will be appropriate for recording.
          Just don’t cover the ceilings and walls in carpet. That’s the worst thing you could do, from both a mixing AND recording perspective.

        <h3 class="list">2. Use moveable panels</h3>
        <p class="description">If the panels that you build or purchase are moveable, you can set them up for specific recording requirements.
          For example, you could make a vocal booth out of 3 panels positioned into a triangle.
          Or you could place a panel in front of a guitar cab to reduce reflections from the opposing wall.</p>

        <h3 class="list">3. Split the room into two halves</h3>
        <p class="description">Dedicate one side to mixing. Add absorber panels at the first reflection points, corners and walls nearest the speakers.
          Then leave the other end of the room ‘live’ with no absorption or treatment.

        <h3 class="list">4. Avoid Foam at All Costs</h3>
        <p class="description">
          A lot of people use acoustic foam to treat their rooms. It’s affordable, and it takes up less space than proper panels, so I can see the temptation.
          But DO NOT be one of those people. Foam has its place in a home recording studio. it’s useful for treating high frequencies. But that’s it.
          Foam will never treat the entire frequency spectrum, and especially not the low end – where you need help the most.
          Build your own panels, and don’t make this common mistake.
